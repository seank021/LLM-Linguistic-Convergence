There was a time when an idea fluttered into my mind like a curious butterfly. On paper, it made no sense at all! But deep inside, there was this warm feeling urging me forward. I followed it blindly at first — sketching wildly on napkins during midnight bursts of inspiration or chatting with strangers who unexpectedly shed light on my path.\n\nAs wild as it sounds, it's almost like dancing through shadows and light — each step guided by something unseen yet profoundly felt.
