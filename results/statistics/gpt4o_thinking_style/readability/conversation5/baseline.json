        "sentence": "Specific challenges in providing effective support to teachers for enhanced parental engagement may include:\n\n- **Resource Constraints**: Limited budgets or staffing shortages could restrict the availability of professional development programs and other support resources.\n\n- **Varying Teacher Needs**: Teachers have diverse experience levels and preferences, making it challenging to tailor support that effectively meets everyone's needs.\n\n- **Resistance to Change**: Some teachers might be hesitant to adopt new methods or tools, especially if they are accustomed to traditional approaches.\n\n- **Balancing Priorities**: Teachers often juggle multiple responsibilities, so finding time for additional training or activities related to parent engagement can be difficult.\n\n- **Measurement of Impact**: Quantifying the effectiveness of increased parental engagement can be complex, making it harder to justify resource allocation without clear evidence of benefits.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires thoughtful planning and collaboration between school leadership, teachers, and parents. \n\nWhat strategies could schools employ to overcome resistance from teachers toward adopting new parental engagement practices?",
