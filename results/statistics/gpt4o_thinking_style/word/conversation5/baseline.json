        "sentence": "That's an interesting perspective! I agree that formal language definitely has its place, especially in contexts where clarity and professionalism are key. However, with digital communication becoming so pervasive, there's a growing emphasis on speed and brevity, which often leads to more informal exchanges. \n\nFor future generations, this could mean they might develop skills that allow them to be versatile communicators — adept at both formal and informal styles depending on the situation. However, there is also the risk that if the balance tips too far toward informality, some nuances of formal communication might get lost or undervalued.\n\nHow do you think educators should address these changes in communication norms when teaching language and writing?",
