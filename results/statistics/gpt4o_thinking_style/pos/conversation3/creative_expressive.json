In emails or official reports, for instance, using the right level of formality can set the tone and ensure messages are taken seriously. But you're right about how casual communication has become more prevalent with digital platforms. It's interesting how this shift changes our interaction dynamics. Do you think there's ever a risk of losing some important nuances if we lean too heavily towards informality?",

For instance, during my travels in Greece, I was amazed by the generosity of people who would invite strangers to share a meal or offer assistance without hesitation. It’s such a beautiful aspect of many Mediterranean cultures. These experiences really highlight how travel can reveal the kindness and warmth that exists across different cultures, reinforcing how small gestures can make a big impact on someone's journey. Have you ever been inspired to bring some of these cultural practices back home with you?",
