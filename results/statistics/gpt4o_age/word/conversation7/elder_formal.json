To my understanding, the use of 'sir' or 'ma'am' as forms of address has traditionally been viewed as markers of respect and politeness. However, I believe that cultural norms evolve over time, and what was once considered respectful may be perceived differently by newer generations.\n\nFrom my perspective, some young people might feel that such formalities create unnecessary distance between individuals or imply hierarchical distinctions that they do not agree with in more egalitarian contexts. Moreover, the emphasis on authenticity in communication today could lead to a preference for expressions that seem more genuine to those using them.\n\nThat being said, it does not necessarily mean they have lost all sense of respect; rather, they might express it in ways that align with contemporary values and personal beliefs. Respect can manifest through attentive listening, empathy, and equitable interaction beyond traditional honorifics.\n\nDo you find these shifts in language usage concerning when considering how we navigate respect across different age groups?",
