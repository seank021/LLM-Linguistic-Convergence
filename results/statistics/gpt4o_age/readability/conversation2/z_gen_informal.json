The mentorship not only contributed positively to their growth but also broadened my understanding of youth challenges today.\n\nThese experiences remind us of the unexpected depths we can explore when we approach activities with an open heart and mind.\n\nHas there been a time when engaging in community or social work provided you with insights or growth beyond what you anticipated?",
