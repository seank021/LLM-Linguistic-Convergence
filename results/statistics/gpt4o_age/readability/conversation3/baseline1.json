This requires reaching out proactively to underrepresented groups or quieter voices to capture a comprehensive view.\n\nBalancing conflicting feedback from different stakeholders—students, educators, and industry partners—can also be tricky. Institutions must find ways to harmonize varied expectations while still adhering to educational standards and goals.\n\nMoreover, there might be resistance from both academic staff and industry representatives when it comes to implementing changes based on student input, especially if it contradicts traditional practices or perceived priorities.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, transparent communication about how feedback will be used—and demonstrating actual outcomes resulting from it—can build trust among students that their opinions truly matter.\n\nHow do you think institutions should handle situations where student feedback suggests significant curriculum changes?",
