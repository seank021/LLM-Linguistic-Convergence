I think formal language still plays a crucial role, especially in professional or academic settings where clarity and respect are essential. It helps maintain a certain standard that can prevent misunderstandings.\n\nHowever, with the rise of digital communication, informal language has become more prevalent because it often feels more personal and relatable. For example, social media platforms encourage quick exchanges that might seem too rigid if overly formal.\n\nHave you noticed any specific situations where switching between formal and informal styles made a big difference in how your message was received?",

It’s interesting to consider the factors that might influence this choice. For me, audience and purpose are key determinants. If I'm addressing someone in a professional or unfamiliar context, I lean towards formality to ensure respect and clarity. Conversely, with friends or in less structured settings, an informal tone often feels more genuine and engaging.\n\nSometimes the medium itself dictates the tone—emails might be more formal compared to quick texts or social media messages, which naturally tend toward informality due to their brevity.\n\nHave you ever found yourself surprised by someone's reaction when you used one style over another? How did it affect the conversation?",
