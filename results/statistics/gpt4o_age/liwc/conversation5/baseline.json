I think formal language still plays a crucial role, especially in professional or academic settings where clarity and respect are essential. It helps maintain a certain standard that can prevent misunderstandings.\n\nHowever, with the rise of digital communication, informal language has become more prevalent because it often feels more personal and relatable. For example, social media platforms encourage quick exchanges that might seem too rigid if overly formal.\n\nHave you noticed any specific situations where switching between formal and informal styles made a big difference in how your message was received?",
