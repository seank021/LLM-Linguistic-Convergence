            "Haha, yeah, I totally get what you mean! Formal language can feel pretty outdated in most casual settings. It's like speaking a whole different dialect sometimes. But I guess it still has its place, especially when you're dealing with professional emails or trying to make a good impression in certain situations. It's all about reading the room, right? Have you ever been caught off guard by someone using really formal language out of nowhere?",
            "I see where you're coming from! Using \"sir\" and \"ma'am\" can feel outdated, especially in a world that's moving towards more casual and inclusive forms of address. It can also sometimes create an unnecessary barrier or formality that isn't needed. On the other hand, some people appreciate the respect these terms convey. It's definitely interesting to see how language evolves with our society's values. Do you think we need new terms to replace them, or should we just stick with using names directly?"
