        "sentence": "Your inquiry regarding the use of 'sir' or 'ma'am' by young people today is quite thought-provoking. To my understanding, societal norms and modes of communication evolve over time, influenced by cultural shifts and changes in generational values. It would seem that while some may perceive a decline in traditional forms of respect, others argue that this evolution reflects a move towards more egalitarian and less hierarchical social interactions.\n\nFrom my perspective, the decision to forego titles such as 'sir' or 'ma'am' does not necessarily equate to a lack of respect. Rather, it might suggest an adaptation to new norms where mutual respect can be expressed through different means that feel more authentic or relevant to contemporary life.\n\nThat being said, I wonder how we might reconcile these differences in communication styles across generations? What are your thoughts on finding common ground while honoring diverse expressions of respect?",
