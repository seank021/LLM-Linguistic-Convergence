For me, it's all about reading the room's vibe and checking facial expressions or body language to decide if people are down for a joke or if I should keep it pro.\n\nA cue I go by? If people start looking tense or like they're zoning out, I'll slide in something funny but not too wild just to see how it lands. But TBH, playing safe with a neutral comment first can help test those waters before diving into humor.\n\nWhat's your secret sauce for breaking tension without stepping on toes?
