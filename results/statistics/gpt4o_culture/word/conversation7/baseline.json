In education, for example, it might be effective to teach traditional grammar and pronunciation as the foundation while also exposing students to diverse dialects and contemporary language uses. This can foster an understanding of formal standards while appreciating linguistic diversity.\n\nIn media, embracing both traditional and evolving forms of language can engage different audiences effectively. News programs or educational content may stick closer to standard grammar for clarity, whereas entertainment media might lean more into slang and informal speech to connect with viewers on a personal level.\n\nManaging this balance could involve creating spaces where both forms are celebrated — such as encouraging the use of community-driven language in creative writing or digital platforms while maintaining certain standards in official communications.\n\nHow do you think technological advancements like AI could play a role in supporting this linguistic evolution?",
