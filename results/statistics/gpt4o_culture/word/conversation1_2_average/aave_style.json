First off, there’s the risk of cultural blending or even losing unique aspects as tech platforms often push dominant narratives over smaller, local ones.

The danger here is oversimplification that loses the richness of what makes them special.\n\nPlus, there's the issue of protecting intellectual property rights when sharing cultural expressions online. Without proper safeguards, communities could see their traditions used or commercialized without consent—a real threat to authenticity and respect for originators.\n\nOverall, while technology offers immense potential for cultural preservation and global connection, it requires careful navigation to ensure these efforts remain respectful and genuinely beneficial to those they're meant to serve.\n\nWhat you think can be done by communities themselves to tackle some of these issues head-on?",
