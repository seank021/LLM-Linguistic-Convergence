However, in casual day-to-day conversations, people are more comfortable with informal language because it feels more authentic and relatable. The shift towards informal communication is probably due to the rise of digital platforms where brevity and a relaxed tone are often valued.\n\nDo you think this shift affects how we perceive authority or professionalism?",
