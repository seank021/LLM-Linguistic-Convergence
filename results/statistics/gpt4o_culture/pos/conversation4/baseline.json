If they seem tense, maybe ease into things more gently; if they're relaxed and open, you can be a bit more casual.\n\nI also listen to their tone of voice. Sometimes the way people speak gives clues about how they’re feeling—like if they're talking fast and loud, maybe they're excited or nervous. Matching energy without mimicking helps too—you stay authentic but show you're in tune with them.\n\nListening actively and showing empathy go a long way too.

It was during a group project, and tensions were high because of miscommunication and differing opinions. Instead of letting it escalate, I decided to call out the elephant in the room and express how the tension was affecting everyone.\n\nBy being honest about my feelings without pointing fingers, it opened up space for others to do the same. Once everyone dropped their guards and shared their perspectives openly, we realized most disagreements were just misunderstandings.\n\nIt’s cool seeing how bringing realness into a tense situation can shift everything toward resolution and cooperation.\n\nHave you noticed any long-term benefits from prioritizing authenticity in your relationships?",
