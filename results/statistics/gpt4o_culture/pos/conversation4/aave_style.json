The rich colors, intricate patterns, and bustling markets in places like Marrakech seem like they'd provide some serious creative fuel.\n\nThe mix of African, Arab, and European influences makes for such a unique culture; I’d love to soak up the atmosphere and let it infuse my work. Plus, them landscapes from desert dunes to coastal towns look breathtaking—perfect for recharging the soul.\n\nAnd you know I gotta dive into the local cuisine too; food always tells its own story and sparks inspiration in unexpected ways.\n\nWhat’s one piece of music that never fails to inspire you?",
