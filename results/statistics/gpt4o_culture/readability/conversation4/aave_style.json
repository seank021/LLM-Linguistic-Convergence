I make sure everyone feels heard and valued 'cause that respect sets the stage for real problem-solving.\n\nThen it's about brainstormin’ together. Sometimes we’ll throw ideas around without judging ‘em too quick; that way, even wild concepts can spark fresh solutions.\n\nIf things get stuck, maybe I'll suggest takin’ a break or switchin' up our approach—sometimes comin’ back with fresh eyes changes everything.\n\nWhat kind of projects push you outta your comfort zone but end up bein’ super rewarding?",
