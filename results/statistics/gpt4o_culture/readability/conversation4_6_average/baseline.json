Instead of letting it escalate, I decided to call out the elephant in the room and express how the tension was affecting everyone.\n\nBy being honest about my feelings without pointing fingers, it opened up space for others to do the same. Once everyone dropped their guards and shared their perspectives openly, we realized most disagreements were just misunderstandings.\n\nIt’s cool seeing how bringing realness into a tense situation can shift everything toward resolution and cooperation.\n\nHave you noticed any long-term benefits from prioritizing authenticity in your relationships?",

Traditional approaches, like face-to-face storytelling or hands-on art activities, offer personal connection and engagement that's hard to replicate digitally.

Combining both means students can benefit from diverse experiences — learning interpersonal skills while also honing tech-savvy abilities. It’s about finding what works best in different contexts and allowing students to choose based on their strengths and interests.
