Compare them against broader strategic objectives to ensure alignment, not just meaningless data collection.\n\nInvolve cross-departmental leaders in the discussions so it's not a siloed exercise. Hold their feet to the fire if metrics indicate misalignment with organizational goals—consequences need to be part of this picture.\n\nBut let’s cut to the chase: will your organization actually commit to dissecting these metrics thoroughly and frequently, or will they only pay lip service until it becomes too much effort?",
