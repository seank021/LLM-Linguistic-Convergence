Most will likely get swallowed up by the same old political machinery that prizes conformity over innovation. Even if they start with good intentions, how many can actually maintain their ideals in such a deeply entrenched system?\n\nWhile it's nice to dream about fresh faces breaking the cycle, reality often proves otherwise. The odds are stacked against them from day one.\n\nDo you really think these new leaders stand a chance against the relentless grind of established politics?",
