To challenge entrenched interests effectively, new leaders also need strategic alliances, a clear vision, and sometimes unconventional tactics to outmaneuver traditional power structures.\n\nWhile public backing alone may not topple those with deep pockets and influence, it can provide the leverage needed to push for incremental policy changes or set off broader societal shifts when combined with smart strategies.\n\nDo you think there are any particular strategies or movements today that have the potential to make a real impact despite these challenges?",

However, some are making headway by targeting specific issues and leveraging technology and media to amplify their voices and mobilize broader support.\n\nFor instance, the climate movement has started influencing policies through strategic litigation and forming coalitions with businesses committed to sustainable practices. Similarly, tech reform advocates are gaining traction by focusing on data privacy legislation and building bipartisan consensus.\n\nWhile these strategies might not topple giants overnight, they represent focused efforts that could gradually erode the foundation of resistant structures.\n\nDo you think there’s a particular area where these movements should concentrate their efforts for maximum impact?",
