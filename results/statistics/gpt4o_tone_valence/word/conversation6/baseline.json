Quantitatively, key performance indicators (KPIs) like productivity levels, cost savings, or time efficiencies are valuable for assessing tangible impacts.\n\nOn the qualitative side, gathering feedback from team members about their experiences with the new initiative can provide insights into how it has affected morale, collaboration, and overall work satisfaction. Often these softer metrics can indicate long-term sustainability better than numbers alone.\n\nCustomer feedback is another crucial indicator if applicable—whether it's external clients or internal stakeholders—to understand how changes have been perceived outside the immediate team.\n\nI also look at innovation-specific metrics such as idea generation rates or improvements in creative problem-solving approaches.
