Formal language certainly has its place, especially in professional and academic settings where it can convey respect and clarity. However, with the rise of digital communication, there seems to be a shift towards more casual interactions.\n\nIf I may offer another perspective, perhaps the relevance of formal language depends on the context. In situations that require precision and formality—such as legal documents or certain business communications—it might still be very valuable. On the other hand, for everyday exchanges among friends or even within many workplace environments today, informal language often makes communication feel more relatable and accessible.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you find yourself adjusting your language style depending on who you're communicating with?",
