However, these movements are at least keeping important conversations alive and increasing pressure on those in power.\n\nSometimes it's the combination of mounting public pressure and a triggering event that compels action—like widespread protests leading to policy discussions. The momentum from undercurrents can help set the stage for more decisive shifts when a tipping point is reached.\n\nDo you think current leadership or political landscapes might be able to respond effectively if such a tipping point were reached?",

Until there's enough public demand or a crisis that can't be ignored, many will stick with business as usual.\n\nDo you think there’s any hope for emerging leaders who might break this cycle, or is it all just more of the same?",
