Tie these efforts directly into performance reviews and strategic goals so they're impossible to ignore.\n\nCreate cross-functional teams tasked with sustaining the culture shift—people who live and breathe this stuff, whose sole job is to keep the flame burning even when distractions threaten to douse it out.\n\nBut let's get real for a second: do you honestly think your organization has the discipline to keep their foot on the gas, or will they lose steam once the novelty wears off? Is this transformation genuinely part of your core strategy, or are we talking yet another flavor-of-the-month initiative that'll vanish into thin air?"
