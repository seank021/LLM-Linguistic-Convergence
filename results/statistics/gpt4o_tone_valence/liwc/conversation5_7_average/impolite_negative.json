People are definitely more aware of climate issues now than they were a decade ago, but awareness doesn't always translate into action or policy change. Institutions? That's another story. They're notoriously slow and resistant to change unless they're forced.\n\nIt'll take consistent pressure from these movements to keep the issue front and center in public discourse and political agendas. But even then, getting institutions on board is like trying to turn a cruise ship with an oar—agonizingly slow.\n\nSo what's your prediction? Will they manage to steer this ship before it hits the iceberg, or are we just rearranging deck chairs at this point?"
