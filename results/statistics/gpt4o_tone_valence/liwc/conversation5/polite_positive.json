People flock to shallow content because it's easy, not because they can't find substance. It's hard to believe they'll suddenly crave depth when they've been conditioned for the opposite.\n\nSure, some might gravitate toward meaningful exchanges, but let's not kid ourselves—most users are more interested in quick dopamine hits than thoughtful discourse. Changing habits on a large scale seems pretty unlikely without a massive cultural shift.\n\nDo you actually think society is ready or willing to make that leap, given how entrenched these behaviors are?",
