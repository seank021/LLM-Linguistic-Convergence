Let’s not fool ourselves into thinking everyone will suddenly become paragons of communication overnight. There'll still be those clinging to outdated ways because they're comfortable or advantageous in the short term.\n\nSo, do you believe there's anything we can do to accelerate this change beyond just waiting for time to work its slow magic?",
