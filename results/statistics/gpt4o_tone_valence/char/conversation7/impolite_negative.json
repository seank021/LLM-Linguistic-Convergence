        "sentence": "Starting these conversations requires a mix of strategic timing and the right framing. Catch them when they're facing a decision point or reevaluating strategies, like during budget planning or after an environmental setback that’s hard to ignore.\n\nFrame sustainability as not just another trend but an inevitable shift they can either embrace now for advantage or be forced into later with less favorable terms. Use language that highlights benefits: competitive edge, innovation, risk mitigation—those buzzwords that make business leaders perk up.\n\nLeverage case studies showing real-world successes from companies who’ve adopted green policies profitably. Sometimes fear of missing out is stronger than fear of change.\n\nBut really, the challenge remains: will they engage with these discussions in good faith or simply nod along until the next distraction?",
