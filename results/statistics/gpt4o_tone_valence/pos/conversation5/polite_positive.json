Sure, it could amplify messages or foster connections if used wisely, but let’s not pretend it's not also part of the problem.\n\nIf anything, leveraging tech to engage people consistently would require combating its own attention-grabbing tactics. You'd need something truly groundbreaking or an all-out marketing assault just to stay relevant amidst digital noise.\n\nDo you honestly think technology can be tamed enough to serve this purpose without getting caught up in its inherent chaos?",
