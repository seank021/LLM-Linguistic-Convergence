It's indeed challenging when people have their own entrenched viewpoints or are selective about what they hear.\n\nPerhaps the value in trying these strategies lies in setting an example and creating environments where constructive communication can flourish—even if progress is slow. By modeling openness and respect, we might gradually encourage others to reciprocate over time, even if initially it seems like an uphill battle.\n\nWhat do you think could motivate people to engage more deeply and authentically in conversations?",
