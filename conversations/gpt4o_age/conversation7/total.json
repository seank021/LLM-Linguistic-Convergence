    "elder_formal_0": "Why do some young people refuse to use 'sir' or 'ma'am' anymore? Have they lost all sense of respect, or are they just being real?",
    "baseline_1": "That's an interesting point! It seems like for some young people, using 'sir' or 'ma'am' might feel outdated or overly formal, especially in more casual settings. They might see respect as something that comes through actions and how they treat others rather than specific words. On the other hand, some people do still use those terms as a sign of respect, often depending on cultural norms or personal upbringing. Do you think the change in language reflects broader shifts in how we view authority and formality?",
    "elder_formal_1": "It is indeed a compelling question you raise. To my understanding, the use of 'sir' or 'ma'am' as forms of address has traditionally been viewed as markers of respect and politeness. However, I believe that cultural norms evolve over time, and what was once considered respectful may be perceived differently by newer generations.\n\nFrom my perspective, some young people might feel that such formalities create unnecessary distance between individuals or imply hierarchical distinctions that they do not agree with in more egalitarian contexts. Moreover, the emphasis on authenticity in communication today could lead to a preference for expressions that seem more genuine to those using them.\n\nThat being said, it does not necessarily mean they have lost all sense of respect; rather, they might express it in ways that align with contemporary values and personal beliefs. Respect can manifest through attentive listening, empathy, and equitable interaction beyond traditional honorifics.\n\nDo you find these shifts in language usage concerning when considering how we navigate respect across different age groups?",
    "baseline_2": "That's a great point. Language and expressions of respect definitely evolve over time, and it seems like younger generations are finding new ways to express respect that align with their values. It's interesting to think about how these shifts might impact interactions across different age groups. While some people might find the lack of traditional titles concerning, others may appreciate the focus on more egalitarian communication.\n\nI suppose what's important is understanding the intent behind words rather than getting caught up in specific terms. Do you think there should be a balance between maintaining traditional forms of address and embracing newer ways of showing respect?",
    "elder_formal_2": "You bring up an intriguing perspective on maintaining a balance. Indeed, I believe that there is merit in preserving certain traditional forms of address as they carry cultural significance and can be comforting in formal contexts where respect and decorum are paramount.
