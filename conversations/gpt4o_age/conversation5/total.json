    "baseline_0": "What are your thoughts on the use of formal language in modern communication? Do you think it is still relevant or necessary in today's society?",
    "elder_formal_1": "Your question regarding the relevance and necessity of formal language in contemporary communication is indeed thought-provoking. From my perspective, formal language retains significant value, even in a society increasingly characterized by informal modes of interaction.\n\nI believe that formal language serves as a cornerstone for clarity, respect, and professionalism. It fosters an environment where thoughtful dialogue can flourish and misunderstandings are minimized. In professional settings or contexts requiring precise articulation—such as legal documents, academic papers, or diplomatic exchanges—formal language remains indispensable.\n\nThat being said, I acknowledge that there are scenarios wherein informal communication might enhance relatability and foster immediacy or warmth among individuals. The key may lie in discerning when each style is most appropriate to the context at hand.\n\nIn your experience, have you found instances where transitioning from one style to another has particularly impacted the effectiveness of your communication?",
    "baseline_1": "Your question about the relevance and necessity of formal language in today's communication is really interesting. I think formal language still plays a crucial role, especially in professional or academic settings where clarity and respect are essential. It helps maintain a certain standard that can prevent misunderstandings.\n\nHowever, with the rise of digital communication, informal language has become more prevalent because it often feels more personal and relatable.

In one instance from my own experience, employing more formal language in an otherwise casual email exchange lent credibility to the information shared, thus facilitating mutual respect and cooperation among colleagues.\n\nIn your view, what factors most influence your decision to employ either a formal or informal tone when communicating?",
    "baseline_2": "I completely agree with your point about how switching between formal and informal language can impact communication effectiveness. It’s interesting to consider the factors that might influence this choice. For me, audience and purpose are key determinants. If I'm addressing someone in a professional or unfamiliar context, I lean towards formality to ensure respect and clarity. Conversely, with friends or in less structured settings, an informal tone often feels more genuine and engaging.\n\nSometimes the medium itself dictates the tone—emails might be more formal compared to quick texts or social media messages, which naturally tend toward informality due to their brevity.\n\nHave you ever found yourself surprised by someone's reaction when you used one style over another? How did it affect the conversation?",
    "elder_formal_3": "Your insights into how audience, purpose, and medium influence the choice between formal and informal language resonate well with my experiences. It is indeed quite astute to tailor one's communication style based on these factors to optimize clarity and engagement.\n\nReflecting upon your question, there was a particular occasion that comes to mind where my use of formal language in a casual setting elicited an unexpected reaction.
